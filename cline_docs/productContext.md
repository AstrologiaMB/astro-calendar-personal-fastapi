# Product Context: Astrological Calendar Application

## Why This Project Exists
The Astrological Calendar Application (astro_calendar_personal_v3) is designed to provide accurate astrological transit calculations for users interested in tracking planetary movements and their aspects to natal chart positions. This tool helps astrology enthusiasts and practitioners plan ahead by knowing when significant astrological events will occur.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Accuracy Issues**: Many existing astrological software solutions use simplified algorithms that sacrifice accuracy for speed, leading to missed or incorrectly timed transits.
2. **Performance Challenges**: Calculating precise astrological transits is computationally intensive, especially for fast-moving planets like Mercury.
3. **Completeness**: Users need a comprehensive view of all relevant transits, including those that occur during retrograde periods or near stationary points.
4. **Usability**: Technical astrological data needs to be presented in a user-friendly format that's accessible to both casual users and professional astrologers.

## How It Should Work
The application follows these core principles:

1. **Astronomical Precision**: Uses advanced astronomical algorithms to calculate planetary positions with high accuracy.
2. **Adaptive Sampling**: Implements smart sampling techniques that increase density during critical periods (like retrograde stations).
3. **Comprehensive Detection**: Ensures all transits are detected, even challenging ones like those occurring during direction changes.
4. **Efficient Processing**: Utilizes parallel processing and optimized algorithms to maintain performance despite the computational complexity.
5. **User-Centric Output**: Converts technical astronomical data into meaningful astrological events with clear descriptions.

The system takes a user's birth chart data as input and calculates all relevant planetary transits for a specified time period (typically a year). It then presents these transits as a chronological calendar of events that the user can reference for personal planning and astrological insight.
